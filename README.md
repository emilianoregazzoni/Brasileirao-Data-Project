## __Brasileirao (CBF) Data Science Project__  

Brasileirao is the most important competition in South America.
In 2021 the competition was chosen by the IFFHS as the strongest national league in South America as well as the strongest in the world. Surpassing Premier League.

Scenario: I am passionate about soccer. Since I was a child I love this sport and one of my dreams, maybe one day, work for a soccer team, 
in a data scientist position.
I want to work with Brasileirao information, and try to discover things about Brazil soccer. Search on the data, clean the data, create some visualizations, identify some patterns and try to predict the new 2023 Brasileirao champion.

:scroll: The stages I am going to follow are:  
Prepare - Process - Analyze - Share - Predict


## Prepare

I have searched on Internet about Brasileirao. I found in Kaggle a nice dataset, but not fully completed. Thanks a lot to Jose Michelin for this 16 years of information about Brasileirao. 

Here the original dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/josevitormichelin/brasileirao-2003-2019

I completed the dataset with information about 2020, 2021 and 2022 taken from Wikipedia.

My dataset combination here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/regazze/brasileirao-2003-2022

Also I created a new column called "Percentage win" that means the amount of points each team reached every tournament. Since 2003 Brasileirao, not every edition has the same amount of matches.
After this step, I have all information needed for start with the process.
